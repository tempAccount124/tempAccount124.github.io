Little did anyone know, these two bundles of fur were about to turn Apple Park into their personal playground, all under the watchful eyes of tech enthusiasts and Apple executives alike.</p><p>The adventure began on a sunny Californian morning, as Paul (the dog’s owner / helper / treat provider), engrossed in his preparations for a Swift workshop, failed to notice Luna and Arya’s growing curiosity about his mysterious destination. Using their sleuth-like senses, the duo decided it was high time they discovered what was so captivating about Paul’s “work.”</p><p>Through a series of comedic mishaps, including a skateboard chase, a dive into a vat of spilled coffee beans, and an unintentional Lyft ride (courtesy of a kindly driver who couldn’t say no to those faces), Luna and Arya found themselves at the gates of Apple Park. With the agility of seasoned escape artists, they slipped through the security perimeter, their fluffy tails just a blur as they dashed into the heart of the action.</p><p>Inside, WWDC was in full swing. Developers from around the globe were immersed in code, oblivious to the furry storm headed their way. Luna and Arya, amazed by the sea of glowing Apple logos, embarked on a whirlwind tour of the premises, leaving a trail of chaos in their wake. From photobombing live interviews to inadvertently launching a demo of the latest visionOS, with a tail wag here and a bark there, they turned the meticulously planned event into an impromptu episode of <em>America’s Funniest Home Videos</em>.</p><p>As the pandemonium reached its peak, with developers tripping over charging cables and keynote speakers distracted by the sight of two Samoyeds chasing their own shadows on stage, a hero emerged from the shadows. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering, known for his charismatic stage presence and luxurious mane of hair, stepped forward with a grin.</p><p>Craig, a dog lover himself, knew just what to do. Harnessing the power of Swift, he whipped out his MacBook and began coding on the fly. Within minutes, he had developed an app: “DogWhispererX,” using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to emit a frequency only Luna and Arya could hear, guiding them gently towards him.</p><p>But Craig didn’t stop there. Recognizing a golden opportunity, he turned the situation into the most memorable WWDC keynote ever. With Luna and Arya now calmly by his side, he introduced “Swift Paws,” a new framework for developing pet-friendly apps. The crowd went wild, their earlier frustrations forgotten, as they envisioned the possibilities of apps that could strengthen the bond between humans and their furry friends.</p><p>Luna and Arya, now the darlings of WWDC, were escorted back to a relieved and amused owner, who couldn’t believe his ears when he heard about their escapades. As a token of gratitude and to much laughter, Craig presented them with custom-made Apple Park Visitor badges, ensuring they’d always be remembered as the Samoyeds who added a touch of whimsy to the world of technology.</p><p>And so, WWDC continued, with developers now sharing not only their love for Swift but also stories of the day when two fluffy intruders reminded them of the joy and unpredictability that pets bring into our lives. Craig Federighi, with his quick thinking and Swift expertise, had saved the day, proving that sometimes, the best solutions come from embracing the unexpected.</p><p>In the end, Paul Hudson’s dogs didn’t just break into Apple Park; they broke into the hearts of everyone at WWDC, leaving a legacy that would be recounted with smiles and laughter for years to come. And as for Luna and Arya, they returned home, exhausted but exhilarated, dreaming of their next big adventure in the wonderful world of tech.</p></p><div><h2 class="text-center mt-5"><a href="https://github.com/twostraws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-secondary" style="margin-right: 20px"><i class="bi-github"></i></a><a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-secondary" style="margin-right: 20px"><i class="bi-twitter"></i></a><a href="https://youtube.com/@twostraws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-secondary" style="margin-right: 20px"><i class="bi-youtube"></i></a><a href="https://mastodon.social/@twostraws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-secondary" style="margin-right: 20px"><i class="bi-mastodon"></i></a></h2><p class="text-center mt-5">Created with <a href="https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite">Ignite</a></p></div></div><script src="/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><script src="/js/syntax-highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
